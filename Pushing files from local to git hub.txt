$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sanju901955@gmail.com"
-> Enter
I have put :9019 as passphrase

ensure ssh agent is running
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

for adding run command
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
give the passphrase:9019

it will add your private key into your ssh-agent

Now adding public key to your git-hub account
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
so it will add to your public key
then go to in git hub setting
@ https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

After running the command as:--$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

paste it onto the git hub within @ https://github.com/settings/ssh/new after giving any title
this only once

go to the files which we wish to push from the local desktop or from the local computer

open the bash here
git init
git add .
commit it and 

git remote add origin git-hub_url
git push origin master
