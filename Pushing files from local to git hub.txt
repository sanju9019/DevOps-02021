$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sanju901955@gmail.com"
-> Enter
I have put :9019 as passphrase

ensure ssh agent is running
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

for adding run command
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
give the passphrase:9019 :--

it will add your private key into your ssh-agent

Now adding public key to your git-hub account
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
so it will add to your public key
then go to in git hub setting
@ https://github.com/settings/ssh/new

After running the command as:--$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

paste it onto the git hub within @ https://github.com/settings/ssh/new after giving any title
this only once

go to the files which we wish to push from the local desktop or from the local computer

open the bash here
git init
git add .
commit it and 

git remote add origin git-hub_url
git push origin master
....................
https way:--
head of the branch means:--latest commit id from where we always work



8. Add the URL copied, which is your remote repository to where your local content from your repository is pushed.

git remote add origin 'your_url_name'
In the above code, The 'origin' is the remote name, and the remote URL is "https://github.com/Olivia-Smithcoder100/FaceDetection.git". You can see the remote as GitHub in this case, and GitHub provides the URL for adding to the remote repository.
9. Push the code in your local repository to GitHub

git push -u origin master is used for pushing local content to GitHub.
In the code, the origin is your default remote repository name and '-u' flag is upstream, which is equivalent to '-set-upstream.' and the master is the branch, name.upstream is the repository that we have cloned the project.
